# How to use it
Create a loop by clicking on points around the screen.
Clicking on the original point (the blue dot) completes the loop.
Press the "Calculate Circulation" button to get the contributions from each segmant in the loop as well as the total magnetic circulation.

Test the result using Ampere's Law by multiplying the enclosed current in Amperes by the permeability of free space.
